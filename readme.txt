#The final programming code used for the project is contained within the 'Final Code' folder. This project was developed with IntelliJ IDEA version 2023.3.2 and to run the program I believe you will need to use this specific version. If you wish to run the program then please follow these steps:
#1. Download the folder to your system
#2. In the 'displaychessBoard' class edit lines 116 and 777 to point to your local system
#3. Run 'Main' in the first src folder (Final Code -> src -> Main.java)

#Depending on the size of your screen the GUI may be loaded incorrectly with the knight and numbers indicating the progression of the tour being placed incorrectly. 
#Resizing the application manually until the first displayed number is in the correct position should resolve the issue.
